# Footprint Logger

Footprint Logger is a beginner-friendly web app that helps users track their daily carbon footprint based on activities like driving, eating meat, or using electricity.

## About the Project

This project was built for a real-world scenario where a local environmental group needed a simple tool for people to track the carbon emissions from their daily activities. The goal is to help raise awareness and encourage more eco-friendly habits.

## Features

- Log daily activities that contribute to CO₂ emissions (transport, food, energy)
- Add custom activities with custom CO₂ values
- View today's total emissions in kilograms
- Filter activities by category (Food, Transport, Energy)
- View a basic bar chart summary by category
- Daily environmental tip shown on page load
- Data is saved in localStorage between sessions

## Technologies Used

- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling and layout
- JavaScript for logic, interactivity, and chart rendering

## Data Storage

The app uses `localStorage` to keep your activity log and custom entries between page refreshes and browser sessions.

## Project Goals

This project was created as part of a real-world build task focused on learning how to:
- Build UI functionality with HTML/CSS/JS
- Store and retrieve data locally
- Work with basic chart rendering
- Apply filtering and dynamic content updates
