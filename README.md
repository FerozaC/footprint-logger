# Footprint Logger

Footprint Logger is a full-stack web application that helps users track and understand their daily carbon footprint.  
It allows individuals to log activities that contribute to CO‚ÇÇ emissions, view personal summaries, and compare their results with the broader community.  

## About the Project

This project was designed for a real-world use case where an environmental group wanted an accessible way for people to track emissions.  
The goal is to raise awareness, encourage eco-friendly habits, and build a sense of community through shared impact.  

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Register and log in with secure JWT-based authentication.
- **Personal Activity Logs**: Save and manage activities tied to your account.
- **Daily & Weekly Summaries**: Track personal footprint totals over time, with streak tracking.
- **Community Average**: See how your footprint compares to other users.
- **Leaderboard**: Highlight users with the lowest footprint to inspire healthy competition.
- **Activity Categories**: Log emissions for food, transport, energy, and custom entries.
- **Date Validation**: Prevents users from logging activities for future dates.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: User-friendly interface to view logs, summaries, and comparisons.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript  
- Chart.js for data visualization  

### Backend
- Node.js with Express.js  
- MongoDB with Mongoose ODM  

### Authentication
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)  
- Bcrypt for secure password hashing  

## Project Goals

This project was created to practice **full-stack development** with a focus on:  
- Designing authentication and protected routes  
- Storing and retrieving user-specific data from a database  
- Building dashboards and visual summaries  
- Implementing community features like averages and leaderboards  
- Strengthening skills in Node.js, MongoDB, and frontend-backend integration  

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/footprint-logger.git
   cd footprint-logger
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:
   ```
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   PORT=5000
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open the app in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## Future Improvements

- Mobile-first responsive design  
- Social sharing of achievements  
- Gamification elements (badges, levels)  
- Integration with external APIs for emission data
