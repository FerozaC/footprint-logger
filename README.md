Footprint Logger is a full-stack web application that helps users track and understand their daily carbon footprint.  
It allows individuals to log activities that contribute to COâ‚‚ emissions, view personal summaries, and compare their results with the broader community.  

## About the Project

This project was designed for a real-world use case where an environmental group wanted an accessible way for people to track emissions.  
The goal is to raise awareness, encourage eco-friendly habits, and build a sense of community through shared impact.  

# Footprint Logger

Footprint Logger is a small full-stack web app for tracking personal COâ‚‚-emitting activities. Users can register, log activities (food/transport/energy/custom), view daily and weekly summaries, and receive realtime tips.

This README covers how to run the project locally, environment variables, and a few implementation notes (socket auth and the global spinner UX).

## Repo layout
- `public/` â€” static frontend (HTML, CSS, vanilla JS)
- `server/` â€” Express server, Mongoose models and API endpoints (this is where you run the Node server)

## Technologies used

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
- Visualization: Chart rendering is done with a simple canvas-based chart (no heavy framework); you may see Chart.js used in earlier versions
- Realtime: Socket.IO for realtime tips and client-server socket communication
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (jsonwebtoken) and bcrypt for password hashing
- Environment/config: dotenv for environment variables
- Development tooling: nodemon for dev reloads, Prettier for formatting


## Quickstart (local development)
1. Clone the repo and open it:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/footprint-logger.git
   cd footprint-logger

2. Install server dependencies (server lives in `server/`):

   cd server
   npm install

3. Create a `.env` file inside the `server/` directory. At minimum set:

   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   PORT=5000

   Note: If `MONGO_URI` is missing the server will start but Mongoose will throw an error when attempting to connect.

4. Start the server in development mode:

   npm run dev

   Or start in production mode:

   npm start

5. Open the app in your browser:

   http://localhost:5000

## Useful commands
- Install server deps: `cd server && npm install`
- Start dev server (nodemon): `cd server && npm run dev`
- Start production server: `cd server && npm start`
- Format files with Prettier (from repo root): `npx prettier --write "public/**/*.{js,css,html}" && cd server && npx prettier --write "**/*.{js,json}"`

## Environment variables
- `MONGO_URI` â€” MongoDB connection string (required for DB routes)
- `JWT_SECRET` â€” secret used to sign JWTs (fallback default exists in code for development but set a secure value for real deployments)
- `PORT` â€” server port (defaults to 5000)

Create the `.env` file in the `server/` directory, not the repo root.

## Notes on socket authentication
- The server uses Socket.IO to deliver realtime tips. When a socket connects the client should emit a `register` event containing the JWT token (not the username). The server verifies the token server-side, extracts the `userId` from the token payload, and joins a room for that user. This avoids trusting client-supplied identifiers.

Client example (already implemented):

```js
// public/script.js
socket = io();
socket.on('connect', () => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
  if (token) socket.emit('register', token);
});
```

Server behavior (already implemented): the server verifies the token with `JWT_SECRET` and, if valid, joins the user's room so it can emit `tip` events to that user.

## Global spinner UX
- The frontend uses a global overlay spinner for long-running actions (login/register and activity logging). Helpers are exposed as `window.showGlobalSpinner()` and `window.hideGlobalSpinner()` from `public/ui.js`.

## API Endpoints (overview)
- `POST /api/register` â€” register new user
- `POST /api/login` â€” returns `{ token, username, email }`
- `POST /api/activities` â€” create activity (protected)
- `GET /api/activities` â€” list user activities (protected)
- `GET /api/activities/weekly` â€” aggregated weekly totals (protected)
- `GET /api/activities/category-summary` â€” category totals for last 7 days (protected)
- `POST /api/goals` and `GET /api/goals` â€” set/get weeklyGoal for user (protected)

Protected routes require an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

## Troubleshooting
- "MongooseError: The `uri` parameter... got 'undefined'" â€” you need to set `MONGO_URI` in `server/.env`.
- If sockets don't receive tips, verify the client emits the JWT token on `register` and that the server's `JWT_SECRET` matches the one used to sign tokens.

## Development tips
- Use `nodemon` (already set up) for automatic restarts: `npm run dev` inside `server/`.
- Format code with Prettier as shown above.

## Contributing / Next steps
- Improve socket auth by exchanging a short-lived socket token after login (optional enhancement).
- Add unit tests for the API and small integration tests for auth flows.
